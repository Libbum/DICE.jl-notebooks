# DICE.jl-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for working through [DICE.jl](https://github.com/Libbum/DICE.jl) examples.

For the moment, only the v2013R (Vanilla Flavour) exists here, since it is the only version that has complete validation.

The Rocky Road and 2016R beta versions can be used in exactly the same manner, but for the moment there is no comparative data available.
Please see [this issue](https://github.com/Libbum/DICE.jl/issues/3) if you can help with running GAMS simulations.
