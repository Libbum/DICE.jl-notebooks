# DICE.jl-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for working through [DICE.jl](https://github.com/Libbum/DICE.jl) examples.
There's a lot of churn happening in the DICE.jl innards at the moment, so until that's settled, there wont be anything more than a simple 2013R Vanilla notebook here.
It's functional and usable right now, but is engineered in quite a different manner than will exist in the near future.
