# DICE.jl-notebooks
Jupyter notebooks for working through [DICE.jl](https://github.com/Libbum/DICE.jl) examples.

For the moment, only the v2013R (Vanilla Flavour) and 2016R beta exist here, since they are the only versions which have comparison data.
Only v2013R should be considered validated at this stage.

The Rocky Road version can be used in exactly the same manner, but for the moment there is no comparative data available.
Please see [this issue](https://github.com/Libbum/DICE.jl/issues/3) if you can help with running GAMS simulations.
